# en_US_GB_CA is a superset of US, GB and CA

# we (lower)
# flew (lower)
# to (lower)
# Abu (mixed)
# Dhabi (mixed)
# via (lower)
# Colombo (mixed)

#LOWERCASE = words_from_archive('en_US_GB_CA_lower.txt')

# {'we', 'flew', 'to', 'via'}
#just add the list of words of the language which you wish to add with lowercase (if its devnagari type  only this will suffice)

# Note that en_US_GB_CA_mixed.txt also contains
# acronyms/mixed case variants of common words,
# so in reality, CASE_MAPPED also contains: 
#
# {'to': 'TO',
